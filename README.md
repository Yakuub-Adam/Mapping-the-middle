## 📝 Project Overview

This project, **Mapping the Middle**, analyzes midfielder performance across the top five European leagues in the 2024/25 season. The analysis focuses on three key aspects:

1. **Defensive Contribution** – Tackles, Interceptions, and Combined Tackles + Interceptions
2. **Ball Progression** – Progressive Carries and Progressive Passes
3. **Creativity & Chance Creation** – Expected Assists (xAG), Passes into the Penalty Area (PPA), and Key Passes (KP)

The goal is to identify top-performing midfielders using statistical metrics and visualize their impact on the game.
